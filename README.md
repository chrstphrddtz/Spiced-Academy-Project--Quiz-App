# Recap Project: Quiz App

link(https://chrstphrddtz.github.io/spiced-project-001/)

## Part I - Layout

In this project I build the layout of my first mobile web application, a quiz app. In later projects I will expand this app and add all sorts of cool functionality. In this app you will be able to:

- Read questions and click buttons to look up the answers.
- Bookmark questions and view them on a bookmarks page.
- Visit your profile page.


## Part II: Quiz App - Interactivity

The focus of the second part of the project was to add interactivity with JavaScript.

- I implemented a toggle functionality for the bookmark and the answer button.
- Users will be able to add new cards to the Quiz App. Therefore I added a page with a form. The data entered into the form by users will be used to create a new question, that will be displayed as a card like the other questions.
- The form fields for question and answer will be limited to a text of 150 characters. While typing users should be informed about the amount of characters left.
