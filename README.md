# Recap Project I: Quiz App - Layout

In this project you will build the layout of your first mobile web application, a quiz app. In later projects we will expand this app and add all sorts of cool functionality. In this app you will be able to:

Read questions and click buttons to look up the answers.
Bookmark questions and view them on a bookmarks page.
Visit your profile page.
❗️ You don't have to worry about how to toggle answers or bookmarks, we will work on that in a later project. But make sure you include the answer texts and bookmark buttons in your app. (You might want to look up the "hidden" attribute)
